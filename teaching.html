					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="editable" id="class-2-title">2018 Spring - Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA.0234)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> This course is an introduction to the mathematical foundations and techniques of modern statistical analysis,
						the fundamental tool for the interpretation of data in quantitative sciences. The course page is maintained on 
						<a href="http://www.github.com/Moosquibe/Mathematical-Statistics">GitHub</a>, while homework assignment and submission will
						be done through <a href="http://newclasses.nyu.edu">NYUClasses</a>.
						<p></p>

						<li> Statistical literacy is essential for anybody who wishes to understand and work with data. 
						The steadily growing demand for skilled data scientist in both industry and academia attracts more and
						more people to this field. Being well versed in the mathematical foundations is certainly
						a way to stick out in the competitive job market. While this is not a machine learning course (although,
						if time permits, we will cover a few simple classification methods), it will provide solid foundations
						for anyone who wishes to continue in that direction.</li>
						<p></p> 

						<li> As this is a math class, the main focus will be on the theory underlying statistical concepts.
						Be advised that we will not simply learn recipes. You will be expected to understand the theory 
						and to be able to write your own logical explanations or proofs. Succesful completion of Theory of 
						Probability or an equivalent course is assumed and the probability material will only be briefly 
						reviewed.</li>
						<p></p>

						<li> Since this is a course about data, you will work with actual examples using Python Pandas 
						with Jupyter Notebooks. While previous familiarity with Python is not expected, it will certainly be
						helpful. We will provide references to tutorials combined with plenty of sample notebooks and 
						you will be expected to pick things up on the fly using these aids. We recommend that you start 
						preparing ahead of time, check back later for references.</li>
						<p></p>
